# Python Copper

Copper is a module aimed at providing low-level hardware abstraction
layers (HAL) as Python modules. Copper aims to create a simple and well
designed API that will allow engineers with a diversity of skill sets and
skill levels to develop complex eletromechanical systems from common
off-the-shelf components.

More information can be found in the
[documentation](https://pycopper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

While developed by Googlers, Copper is not an official Google product.
